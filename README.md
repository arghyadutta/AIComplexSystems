# Code for demonstrating some ideas in the "AI in Complex Systems" course

## General references:

- **Introduction to Machine Learning with Python: A Guide for Data Scientists**, Müller and Guido (Available in the library)
- [An Introduction to Statistical Learning](https://www.statlearning.com/) by by Gareth James, Daniela Witten, Trevor Hastie, Robert Tibshirani, Jonathan Taylor. (Excellent and **free** book, a bit more difficult then Müller's)

## Reading list 

I am making a list of references (papers, book chapters, videos,…)—please read/watch them. While they may not be essential for exams, they are informative, well-written, and persuasive.

## Code repositories I borrowed from:

Codes are often adapted from the following repositories. Please check the sources and *learn from them*—they contain more material and you'll also learn how to write code professionally in the process.

- [Müller and Guido's GitHub Repo accompanying their book](https://github.com/amueller/introduction_to_ml_with_python)
- [GitHub repo for a ML course by Joaquin Vanschoren](https://github.com/ml-course/master)
